            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Stationer TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AT the cloſe of this Letter (which you are here preſented with) the Author has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a fair account of his Deſign in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Memorials, <hi>viz.</hi> in Charity to undeceive ſuch well-meaning Perſons as are ſtill unhappily miſ-led in the ſame way, and miſerably gull'd and abuſed by the uſual Artifice and Cunning of thoſe grave Sinners, who will needs call themſelves the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>People of God,</hi> the <hi>Secret Ones,</hi> and take a Pride in many ſuch fine Names, which in the Eyes of diſcerning men, look not much unlike curious Ornaments throw'n over a foul and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Carcaſe. But I have a farther thought in being aſſiſtant to this Publication, and that is, to
<pb facs="tcp:95382:3"/>gratifie the <hi>Leaders</hi> themſelves; who (Good men) not content with the Kings Gracious Pardon, are now become ſo very bold, as not only to give ſome Commendations of what has been the Cauſe and Ground of all our late <hi>Diſtractions;</hi> but ſtifly to contend for it, and vigorouſly to endeavour the acting over the ſame <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and raiſing the ſame <hi>Devil</hi> again by the ſame Noiſe and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes, which they were taught to make uſe of in the memorable Year of <hi>41.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt other Methods, the memory of thoſe pretious Perſons (as they love to call 'em) who were the grand Ring-Leaders in the late <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> is recommended and endear'd to the People; and what can be leſs intended hereby, than that the People ſhould by this way be brought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good Opinion of their Practices, and be in a readineſs to be ſtirr'd up, whenever a fit and convenient Opportunity ſhall preſent it ſelf unto them.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the Lives of ſeveral of theſe Seducers creep out of the Preſs, and every day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee more. When therefore it ſhall pleaſe them (by publiſhing his Life) to Canonize Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi> they are gratifi'd by being here furniſht with Materials towards that Great Work. And it were eaſie, and I ſhall be ready to do the like
<pb facs="tcp:95382:3"/>kindneſs for thoſe which ſhall be writ here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and for the new Editions of ſuch as are abroad already.</p>
            <p>As to this, I ſhall aſſure thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> that (whileſt the aim of thoſe <hi>Deſigners</hi> is to allure thee with a Godly Varniſh, into a falſe Opinion of the Perſons and Practiſes of ſuch men) this Relation has no other end, but to keep thee from being cheated and befool'd amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Herd of Mankind.</p>
            <p>If now what is here ſent abroad be either ill taken, or interpreted worſe, it is not to be lookt upon as a fault in the Author, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted rather to the diſtemper of ſuch, who are unwilling to be ſeverely and ſincerely dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, tho' it be in order to their <hi>Cure.</hi> He has not here us'd any Arguments to diſſuade ſuch Guides as now-a-dayes profer themſelves almoſt in every Barn or Market-place; partly becauſe 'tis forreign to his purpoſe, and partly becauſe he is ſufficiently aſſured, that if Matters of Fact be weak and unable, Arguments (tho' never ſo good) will be of little force to prevail with them. For ſuch is the reſolv'd obſtinacy of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſort of People, that the cleereſt Argument ſhall not convince, but rather confirm them in
<pb facs="tcp:95382:4"/>their beloved Fooleries. And this is one of their greateſt unhappineſſes, that they take pleaſure in being abus'd; for if any one be ſo friendly, as to deal freely and plainly with them, and venture to give them good and ſound Advice, they preſently kick and fling, thinking themſelves injur'd by what is given out of pure love and kindueſs.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Shortly after Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers</hi> Lecturer at <hi>Wethersfield</hi> deceaſes, and Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> is choſen his Succeſſor, where they purchaſe him a <hi>Library</hi> at the Coſt of <hi>Fifty pounds,</hi> and do many other very friendly Offices for him.

               <p>He had not long continued there, before Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> (a Reverend and Learned Divine) Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Finchingfield</hi> dyeth. The Fatneſs of the Benefice help'd the Patron to Suitors enough; but amongſt all, our <hi>Marſhall</hi> was the Man whom his Affection made choice of, to beſtow his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation upon; who having unluckily married himſelf to <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> knows not what courſe to take to ſue out a <hi>Bill of Divorce.</hi> The great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (worth 200 <hi>l. per annum</hi>) is a ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the <hi>Holy Man's</hi> concupiſcible Appetite, (for tho' our new Saints talk much of Heaven, yet 'tis the Earth they moſt deſire to inherit) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Wethersfield</hi> holds him to his promiſe, <hi>Never to leave them.</hi> A little Aſſembly of Divines (as wiſe almoſt, and as honeſt as the great one) is call'd; 'tis there debated how far Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s promiſe is obligatory. The <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> knowing his mind before, conclude, that it bound him, not to leave them for a <hi>Leſſer Salary;</hi> but left him at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to take a <hi>Bigger Living</hi> when he could get it: and in very deed, there is no reaſon why any promiſe, tho' never ſo ſolemnly, ſo deliberately made, ſhould ſtand a perpetual <hi>Palizado</hi> to any Godly Man's Preferment. Well, however this Deciſion ſatisfies his <hi>Corvan:</hi> For he leaves <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield,</hi> and away he goes to <hi>Finchingfield.</hi> This is the firſt noted Eſſay that he gave of his <hi>Fidelity</hi> in keeping Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s Name is now up, and he may lie in Bed, which he cannot comfortably do without a Bedfellow, who ſeeks him; not taken with any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95382:6"/>Comlineſs of his Perſon, but raviſh'd with the zealous delivery of his <hi>Sermons:</hi> For whatſoever good his Preaching does upon Mens Souls, it works mightily upon Womens Affections. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of a conſiderable Fortune hears him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that ſo warm a Preacher, could not chooſe but make as warm a Huſband; whereupon ſhe diſcovers her Meltings to ſome of the Siſter-hood: They glad to advance their <hi>Ghoſtly Father,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently acquaint him with the Happineſs that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for him.

What ſhall the Good Man now do, who was never born to one Acre of Land? Great care is taken; Prayers are put up for the Succeſs of this Match; Endeavours are uſed; but the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Kindred are reſolv'd to have a Settlement of an Eſtate, or elſe no Match goes forward. And it ſhall be had rather than Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſhall loſe his rich Wife. One <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> was wont to call Father) will now ſhew, that it was not in vain, that he own'd him by that Title; and therefore ſettles an Eſtate of 30 or 40 <hi>l. per annum</hi> (as I have heard) upon him and her.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95382:7"/>Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> that he would do any thing to advance him. However it was wrought, he parts with it, and Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> enjoys his <hi>Love;</hi> but whether ſhe enjoy'd her <hi>Love</hi> is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo certain: 'Tis a common Complaint, that the Devouteſt Preachers are not always the kindeſt Huſbands, nor does the reſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation anſwer that Affection, that they make ſhew of in a Pulpit. <hi>She finds it ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly the Woman, tho' ſhe was not of that politick reach, that ſome others are of, never wanted Ornaments of a meek and quiet Spirit; but her Simplicity, or ſomething elſe made her to be ſlighted, if not ſcorn'd by him: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had made him a Father of one Son and ſix Daughters, he grows weary of her Bed. (I will not ſay to go to anothers; tho' to ſtop the the Mouths of People that began to mutter, he was forced to frequent a Siſters Houſe leſs than he had been obſerv'd uſually to do before) inſomuch that they ſeldom lay together. And it has been obſerv'd, that when he had been for many Weeks together abſent, and came into the Country to take his Tithes and freſh Air, he choſe rather to ſuck it in at Sculkins, than at the <hi>Vicaridge;</hi> and to ſupply the want of his Wife, her Company, he frequently read himſelf aſleep with a <hi>Play-Book</hi> or <hi>Romance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his Children he was (to give him his due) a very indulgent Father, and perhaps more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent than was allowable. The moſt of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95382:7"/>Education was going from one good Houſe to another, to eat <hi>Cheeſ-cakes</hi> and <hi>Cuſtards.</hi> They were like Gentlewomen in nothing beſides their Habits; and therein they exceeded perſons of good Degree and Quality. They followed the height of Faſhions with changeable <hi>Taffata's,</hi> and <hi>Naked Necks,</hi> inſomuch that the Godly Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were ſorely ſcandaliz'd at it; but durſt not complain, becauſe it was Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> who was concern'd. He gave them great Portions; and (as the <hi>Hiſtory of Independency</hi> ſaith) Married one of them with the <hi>Book of Common Prayer,</hi> and a <hi>Ring;</hi> and gave this for a reaſon, That the Statute eſtabliſhing that Liturgy was not yet repeal'd; and he was loth to have his Daughter <hi>Whored,</hi> and turn'd back upon him for want of a Legal Marriage: Nevertheleſs he could declare againſt the uſe of it by others. And ſo the <hi>Jugler</hi> plaid at faſt and looſe with the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> as he had done before with the People of <hi>Wethersfield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will view him next in his Paſtoral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; where (to ſpeak the Truth) he was for many years ſo well beloved of his People, that I think few Miniſters could boaſt of a greater happineſs in that kind: being not moroſe, but of a free and ſociable Humour in his Converſation, and in his Preaching very taking with a Country Auditory: For tho' in his Sermons penn'd, there was nothing extraordinary; yet he had ſuch a kind of Delivery, that he carried away the credit from all: beſides which I think theſe may be ſome cauſes of his Popularity.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95382:8"/>
               <p>Firſt, (till he began to meddle with <hi>State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi>) he always preach'd <hi>Catechiſtical Divinity;</hi> (how happy had the man been, if he had never done otherwiſe?) and that in as plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Expreſſions as could be, that he might ſuit himſelf to the meaneſt Capacity, and gain the People, which was his great, if not his only aim and ambition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he had an art of commending every thing that he delivered, before he deliver'd it, as being moſt ſerious, and of higheſt Concernment to their Souls; which the people always took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Word. Yea, he would ſolemnly profeſs, that what he preach'd to them, he had experience of the work of it upon his own Soul, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced much both to the gaining of Credit to his Doctrine, and to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whenever he diſmiſs'd them, before he had finiſhed the Text or point he was upon, 'twas his Cuſtom to aſſure them, that the <hi>beſt</hi> was <hi>ſtill behind,</hi> which was an invitation to come again and hear the <hi>reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He was acquainted with all the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Proverbs,</hi> and odd Country Phraſes, and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words which he would ſprinkle up and down in his Sermon; which captivated the People at a ſtrange rate.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He toward his latter end, inſiſted much upon Notional (which he call'd <hi>Spiritual</hi>) Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95382:8"/>and the many Privileges of the <hi>Saints;</hi> and ſeldom or never would meddle with particular <hi>Sins</hi> (unleſs it were the Sin of <hi>MALIGNANCY,</hi> or not promoting the <hi>PARLIAMENT CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi>) Yea, he has been heard to ſay, that he durſt not preach againſt their Vices, leſt they ſhould be ſcar'd from his Miniſtry; (this is much of the ſame Complexion with the <hi>Jeſuite's</hi> complying Divinity to gain Diſciples) but if he could make them in love with Jeſus Chriſt, they would ſoon grow weary of their Sins: As if any man before he knows the Evil of Sin, would ſee any need of Chriſt. <hi>Oh wiſe Maſter Builder!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, He preach'd much abroad, and then had his Agents to give notice ten miles about, when he came to any Lecture; (this is the mode of all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of that Gang, by which they gather more Diſciples to themſelves than to Jeſus Chriſt.) When he had well heated himſelf with preaching (which was much to his honour) he had a Siſter or two <hi>(No Nuns)</hi> that waited upon him with Towels and a clean Shirt, which (after they had every where well wip'd him to prevent catching of cold) they put upon him with more Affection, than if it had been a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. And having well refreſhed himſelf with ſome preparatory Caudle, he is ready for his Dinner.</p>
               <p>Tho' the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> counted him theirs, yet all this while he was wary of hazarding his Benefice, by venturing in publick any thing againſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95382:9"/>the Eſtabliſh't Government or Liturgy: Nay, he was as conformable as could be deſired, reading <hi>Divine Service,</hi> wearing the <hi>Surplice,</hi> receiving and adminiſtring the <hi>Sacrament</hi> kneeling, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, commending, extolling <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> obſerving all the <hi>Holy-days</hi> with more than ordinary Diligence, preaching upon moſt of them. This the man did, ſo long as he had any hopes of riſing that way: For that his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuch, I have great reaſon to believe, being aſſured by a worthy Perſon, that he was once an earneſt Suitor to the late unhappy Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> for a <hi>Deanry,</hi> which is the next ſtep to a <hi>Biſhoprick.</hi> The loſs of which (as the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune made <hi>Arrius</hi> turn Heretick) ſo it made him turn Schiſmatick. His Son-in-law <hi>Nye</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>That if they had but made his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Biſhop, before he had been too far engaged, it might have prevented all the War; and ſince he cannot riſe ſo high as a Biſhop, he will pull the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as low as himſelf; yea, if he can, lower than himſelf was at</hi> Gormancheſter. Diſcontented Pride has made more Schiſmaticks than Conſcience; if this has ſlain its thouſands, that has kill'd its ten thouſands.</p>
               <p>There wants not a Conſpiracy of many <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi> to aſſiſt him in this Deſign. Firſt, the too many diſcontented, and upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) diſſatisfied Perſons in this Nation, every where ſpurring one the other on, to foment Troubles and Diſtractions. Then follow'd the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Rebellion, breaking out firſt at Home, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95382:9"/>preſently advancing it ſelf into <hi>England;</hi> which afterward forc'd the Princely Martyr to call that Black Parliament which proved the Ruine of Him, of the Nation, and at laſt (by the juſt hand of Providence) of themſelves too.</p>
               <p>During their Seſſion, an Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <hi>is called, not choſen</hi> by the Clergy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, but ſelected by themſelves; amongſt theſe our Reverend <hi>Marſhall</hi> (by means of Friends) is preferr'd to be one: He quickly grows to be Maſter, and is ſo call'd by all (like the the old <hi>Phariſee</hi> he affected the Name of <hi>Rabbi;</hi>) they ſit, not to conſult for the Reformation of Religion in things that were amiſs, but to receive the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Commands to undo and innovate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In which Work, or rather Drudgery of the Devil, (falſly ſtyl'd <hi>The Cauſe,</hi>) our active <hi>Stephen</hi> needs neither Whip nor Spur: Tooth and Nail he bends himſelf to the overthrow of the Hierarchy, Root and Branch. Thoſe few ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men that were choſen either abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (becauſe they would not be involv'd in their pernicious and heady Suffrages) or being thrown out by them, they do all their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> till <hi>Independency</hi> began to check, and at laſt Mate-<hi>Presbytery.</hi> They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to their Power, if not in Voting down the Biſhops, yet in keeping them down by their trepanning Covenant, (a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Jig plaid and danc'd by the giddy Brethren in <hi>England.</hi>) In which I cannot but take notice of their baſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, in ſuffering the major part of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95382:10"/>(that bowed to that <hi>Dagon</hi>) to take it in the plain <hi>Grammatical</hi> Senſe of it; yet to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Party, giving leave to ſome more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and eminent perſons to take it in their own Senſe. This Falſity God doth judge and will judge.</p>
               <p>To Countenance their Proceedings, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with Foreign Divines of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches: as <hi>Johanan (Jer.</hi> 42.) and the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> concerning their going into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> reſolv'd to follow his Counſel, if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with theirs, yet to go, tho' God and He ſaid nay; if the advice of thoſe Divines had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded their Intentions (which they never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned) they would have heard it, and the World ſhould have heard it. But yet they reſolved to take their own Courſe, tho' <hi>Geneva</hi> ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the contrary; as indeed they prudently did, and therefore they bury the Foreign Letters, till time brought them to light by a ſtrange Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And that the Foreign Divines might trouble them no more with freſh Letters, they clap them in the Mouth with a Lye, that they intended no harm to regulate Epiſcopacy, but only to the Lordly and Tyrannical Regiment of it. Let their Actions be heard ſpeaking againſt them, they do not only uncover the Roof, and take down the Pyramids and Battlements of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy; but like the rough Sons of <hi>Edom,</hi> they raze it even to the Ground; and inſtead thereof, ſet up its Rival, the proud, ſwelling, domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faction of <hi>Presbytery;</hi> which Muſhroom-like,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95382:10"/>ſuddenly ſprang up, and as ſuddenly diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at beſt does truckle under its younger Brother <hi>Independency.</hi> Which our <hi>Stephen</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, (and as he could not be the <hi>Protomartyr,</hi> ſo he was reſolved not to be the <hi>Deuteromartyr</hi> of that Name) quickly diſowns his own ſweet Babe, and (with a little of honeſt <hi>Ny</hi>'s Aſſiſtance) puts himſelf into the thriving Sect of the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> bidding <hi>New England</hi> welcome into the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the Church could not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the King, who was more firmly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, than Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> either to his Wife, or his firſt Living; the King and all who adhere to him and the Church muſt be deſtroyed with it: to whoſe Ruine Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> contributes not a little. Witneſs Thundrings in all Pulpits; his Curſing all people who were backward in their engaging againſt him; his encouraging all thoſe, whoſe Villany made them forward in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking that great Work, warranting them no ſmall Preferment in Heaven, if they would lay down their Lives for the <hi>Cauſe:</hi> Witneſs his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and private Incitations, becoming <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>major,</hi> or <hi>Chaplain-General</hi> to the Army; praying from Regiment to Regiment at <hi>Edge-hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Witneſs his riding Poſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to treat with the <hi>Scots,</hi> in order to their coming into <hi>England;</hi> in which buſineſs he ſo demean'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the <hi>Kirk Party,</hi> pawning his Soul, and his Brethrens here in <hi>England</hi> (for a leſs Pledge
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95382:11"/>would not be taken) in a wicked League for Conformities Sake, that the two Nations might be one in a Religious Conſpiracy; that they eſpouſe their Cauſe, and in it defend their own Guilt, by an Additional Conſpiracy with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels. This Journey, men ſay, was worth 500 <hi>l.</hi> to him; I believe more.</p>
               <p>Witneſs his perſwading the City to lend the Parliament 50000 <hi>l.</hi> to pay their Souldiers, who were ready to mutiny in a ſeaſonable time: then perſwading the City to let the Army march through them, and poſſeſs the Tower. This he did to aſſure the <hi>Independents,</hi> that he is really theirs: So he is ſent down a Second time into <hi>Scotlend,</hi> to lye again for his Maſter's Profit; and thither goes <hi>Balaam</hi> again for love of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Unrighteouſneſs. But this Voyage was not ſo acceptable to the dear Brethren as the former, if all be true that I have heard, <hi>viz.</hi> that in a Storm it hail'd rotten Eggs upon his Head at <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> They being cunning Juglers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſoon ſmelt a Cheat. Beſides it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that tho' he rode Poſt, ſome body had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtript him with Letters, and acquainted the Kirk, that he was become a Changeling and Apoſtate from <hi>Presbytery,</hi> then which a greater Crime could not there be charged upon him. So he returns to the <hi>Rump,</hi> to tell them he loſt his Journey.</p>
               <p>Having loſt his Credit too in <hi>London,</hi> and his Pariſh at St. <hi>Margarets</hi> growing cold in their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95382:11"/>Affections to him, and his 300 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for preaching at the <hi>Abby</hi> failing, he returns to his old forſaken Love (I do not mean his Wife, but) <hi>Finchingfield;</hi> and there he finds neither the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nor Reſpect that he was wont. His Slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of them had taught them as little to eſteem him. They conſtrue his Retreat thither but a forc'd Putt, and ſay openly, that if he could have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his Maintenance any where elſe, he would have ſold them for two pence profit: and inſtead of ſending Tithes, when demanded, they ſend him Jeers and Frumps; rate him above what he could make of his Living, over-rule him, who was wont to over-rule all men. His high Stomach not brooking this Carriage, he grows weary there, and waits the next opportunity to be gone, which offers it ſelf thus:</p>
               <p>The Lecturer of the great Church in <hi>Ipſwich</hi> dies. He is thither invited by the Town, with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> if his Conſcience could relinquiſh his preſent <hi>Cure:</hi> A Scruple that troubled him not at all; for he had often ſear'd his Conſcience before with the ſame Iron. However, being a Man of an affected Gravity, and loth to do any thing lightly or paſſionately, he therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Reaſons to depart from <hi>Finchingfield;</hi> among which this was the chiefeſt: He found his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ineffectual. Thoſe who were good of Old time were good ſtill; but in his late years teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he could not find any new Convert.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95382:12"/>
               <p>Truly the People had little reaſon (I confeſs) to credit him in any thing, who had ſo perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly betray'd their Souls, by leading them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rebellion. But how knew he that none were converted? The Signs of Grace do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſently appear to the Convert himſelf, much leſs are they viſible to the view of others. Beſides, ſince God had forſaken his Miniſtry at <hi>Finch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingfield,</hi> what aſſured hopes had he of doing good at <hi>Ipſwich?</hi> Yet <hi>Balaam</hi> Saddles his Aſs, and will go with the Men; but a few Idolizers of him, firſt petition him with a Scroll of hands to ſtay, thinking that horrible darkneſs muſt needs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread that <hi>Horizon,</hi> if ſo great a Luminary ſhould bid a final farewell to it. This will not do; <hi>Baal</hi> will not hear; next they petition God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. A private Faſt is appointed to be kept at Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s in <hi>Finchingfield:</hi> Three Miniſters carry on the Work of the day. Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> being the Oldeſt, begins the Devotions; but inſtead of ſupplicating for his Stay, he tells God Almighty a very foul Story of his Rambling. I cannot give you the very words, 'tis ſo long ſince they were ſpoken, and I heard them; but as I remember, they were to this purpoſe, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Marſhall <hi>lov'd the Company of great Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that he had a gadding Humour, before he had left his Pariſh to go live at</hi> London, <hi>and follow the Camp, and would now be gone to</hi> Ipſwich, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You ſhall not need to wonder at this: For it is verily believed by many, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Cordial Affection between theſe two Grand <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> one envying another's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95382:12"/>For they ſeldom met, but they hunch't at one another. Once a Diſh of Apples being brought before them, and the Company, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one liked, preferring one Apple before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaid he lov'd a <hi>Living.</hi> I think ſo, quoth Mr. <hi>Marſhall;</hi> for you are always whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for more. And you, ſays Mr <hi>Rogers,</hi> love a <hi>Runnet,</hi> for you can never keep at Home.</p>
               <p>But to return from this Digreſſion, neither Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to Man, nor Prayers to God, will ſtay him: For he packs up his Tools, and is gone for <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> where he joys not long; for he is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with Affliction upon Affliction: Indeed he had loſt his Eldeſt Son before, who was drown'd at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> which was a great vexation to him, that his Name ſhould periſh. In a ſhort time, he buries three Daughters, and ſeveral Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and laſt of all his Wife, whom he could beſt have ſpar'd; (ſome of his <hi>Ipſwich</hi> Neighbours were bold to interpret theſe Loſſes to be the puniſhment of his deſerting <hi>Finchingfield</hi>) ſoon after, himſelf was viſited with a Conſumption, which ended his Days at <hi>London.</hi> Of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:</p>
               <p>His Religion ſtood moſt in Externals; a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Obſervation of Sabbaths, Praying, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (eſpecially according to the new mode) in Faſts, and Thankſgivings; under theſe ſpecious ſhews, the Miſtery of Iniquity lay hid. For to what end were their Faſts, but for Strife, and to ſmite with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs, and to break

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95382:14"/>the Strength and Heart of the King? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were their Thankſgivings, but for Succeſs in Rebellion? Whereas they had more reaſon to thank God for his Forbearance, that the Earth did not open, and ſwallow them up quick, as it once did their Fellow-Rebels. But this made a great Noiſe among the ſilly People, who ſaw no farther than a Man may look into a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
               <p>His Jureverence about Holy things was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and hardly credible; when he baptized a Child in Private, to ſit in a Chair upon his Breech, while he adminiſtred that Sacrament. What Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition could equalize that Rudeneſs? Perhaps he thought the ſame poſture would as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that Sacrament as the other: ſuch doings have brought both into Contempt. Indeed to him and his Brethren, we owe not only the loſs of our Government and Liturgy, but of the Sacraments themſelves: Baptiſm having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, and the Lord's Supper in many places diſus'd. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> himſelf having not had a Communion in <hi>Finchingfield</hi> for ſeven Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is far worſe than Promiſcuous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions.</p>
               <p>That he was of all Clergy-men, the moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to his Sovereign, is without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, every where robbing him of the Hearts of his Subjects, creating Jealouſies in them, ſtirring them up to Arms and Contributions of Moneys, engaging all Perſons of Quality, whom he had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95382:14"/>any hopes to work upon: and when he found the man backward, he plays the Devil, tempts the Woman to betray her Huſband. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſtrong influence upon that Sex, and wrought that by their Importunity, which he could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by his own reaſon or perſwaſions. By this means he became a Murderer, a Murderer of thoſe Souls that he had ſeduc'd into Rebellion; a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of thoſe Bodies which were ſlain by ſuch as he ſtirr'd, up to the War; a Murderer of all ſuch as died by the Hands of the Royaliſts; a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of his Prince, by taking away his good Name, by that means rendring him in the eſteem of his Subjects, unworthy to govern or live; and this he did not only by his Preaching and private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies; but in thoſe abſurd, dinſ-ingenuous, and malicious Animadverſions of his upon the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taken at <hi>Naſeby;</hi> Letters ſo full of Modeſty, Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, Wiſdom and Piety, yet if he had not had the Heart of a — very bad man, he would never have ſo maliciouſly Commented upon them, and made them ſpeak contrary to their own <hi>Grammatical</hi> Senſe: Letters, that when Malice had done its worſt, and its religious Votaries had pick'd out of the Cabinet ſuch as they thought would beſt ſerve their turn (ſuppreſſing ſuch Papers as might have given all the World ſatisfaction of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Love to his Subjects and the Proteſtant Religion,) and had diſcanted upon thoſe ſelect Papers; yet were ſo far from prejudicing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that they convinc'd thouſands of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, who were before doubtful. The worſt that could be laid to his Charge, was, that contrary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95382:15"/>to former Reſolutions, he ſought help from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, forc'd thereunto by their implacable Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Beſides this, he is thought to have inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them (who were forward enough) to the haſtening the King's Death. He has been heard to ſay, <hi>That the King was too wiſe to be ſuffer'd to Rule. That he had as live ſee his own Death, as the King in his Throne.</hi> His revengful Spirit could not forget that Affront (as he accounted it) which the King put upon him at <hi>Holmby;</hi> when being to ſay Grace for his Majeſty, while he was long in forming his Chaps (as his manner was) his Majeſty ſaid Grace for himſelf, and was fallen to his Meat, and had eaten up ſome part of his Dinner, before his Chaplain had ended his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Creature. The King then checking him, and ſaying, that he intended not to ſtay till his Meat was cold, whilſt he ſtood whiſtling for the Spirit: Which Check never went out of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach till it rotted out. That well might one of his own Gang ſay, <hi>He died in time, or elſe he might have taken a Turn with</hi> Hugh Peters <hi>at</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Croſs: of which his Arreſt at <hi>Cambridge</hi> was an unlucky <hi>Omen,</hi> which was a miſtake and no miſtake. I know, ſome affirm, that when the King was dead, he was much perplext, and repented of what he had done. For my part, I rather think them tranſient Pangs and Gripes of Conſcience, than true remorſe for his publick Sins.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he never publickly recanted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he never labour'd to undeceive thoſe whom he had ſeduced.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95382:15"/>
               <p>Thirdly, He ſtill joyned himſelf to his old wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Company, even the King's Murderers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He acted under the Grand Uſurper; was as harſh and ſevere as ever to the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for he was no leſs malicious to his Friends all along than to him; always oppoſing them, if they came to the Aſſembly for Examination, or after the Tryers at <hi>White-hall,</hi> (for he was one of thoſe <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Inquiſitors) pretending, forſooth, only Care to advance Godly and able men; and yet could prefer his Son-in-law <hi>Nye,</hi> to a Living of 400 <hi>l.</hi> a year, who never deſerv'd one of 40 <hi>l.</hi> I come now to deſcribe his Virtues.</p>
               <p>His Charity in giving, was as little as his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in forgiving; never ſo much as beſtowing a penny, or piece of Bread at his Door the year throughout, tho' he had many poor Kindred, and ſome who lived not far from him; yet out of his abundance, never gave them the worth of Twelve pence, as themſelves have ſaid. Nay, (when he had the World flowing in upon him) he ſuffer'd his poor Father to beg about the Country; which ſhew'd he had neither Shame nor pity, nor yet any Natural Affection.</p>
               <p>And tho' men ſay, the <hi>Puritan</hi> will not ſwear, but will lye damnably. This Impoſtor both ſwore and ly'd, having ſeveral times taken the Oaths of Allegiance, and Canonical Obedience, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, and his own Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; all which for the Glory of God, and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95382:16"/>this Nation, he as ſolemnly broke and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded others to break: that if his Soul had not load enough of his own perſonal Perjuries, he might ſink it with the addition of other mens.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, you ſhall not need to queſtion his Truth: For verily he was a man that would not deceive him who never truſted him. He is a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in Print, of which there needs no other Proof than his own Preaching up of Rebellion for God's Cauſe, which is a Lye in Text; and what were all his Faſts and Thankſgivings, but Lyes in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, lying not only to men, but to the Holy Ghoſt? At the Funeral of Mr. <hi>Borradel</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Bumſted</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he had this reach in his praiſe, <hi>That upon his knowledge, he had wept a Buſhel</hi> (that's a dry meaſure) <hi>of Tears for the Sins of his People.</hi> If ſo, how many Buſhels would the reſt that he was not privy to have amounted to? Sure Mr. <hi>Borradel</hi> had a very moiſt Brain, or Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> a ſlippery Tongue; for certainly without an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> of the largeſt ſize, this muſt be a loud one. A Lye not inferiour to this, was that, which he had at the Funeral of <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> (where after he had made a Lying Face or two)
<q>
                     <hi>— Manúque ſimul veluti Lachrymantia terſit Lumina—</hi>
                  </q> For not one Tear came; he very gravely told the People (who were no Strangers to Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Infirmities) <hi>He had Grace enough for ten Men, but not for himſelf: He was,</hi> (as I told you) <hi>at the Fight
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95382:16"/>at</hi> Edge-hill (when he had better have been in his Pulpit at <hi>Finching field) very ſore diſtreſs'd for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his ſide to run, and hearing the</hi> Cavaliers cry, <hi>Have at the Black-Coats,</hi> meaning himſelf and Mr. <hi>Aſh,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> complainingly miſappli'd that Scripture to the Rebels which was ſpoken of the People of God, <hi>What ſhall we ſay when</hi> Iſrael <hi>turns his back upon his Enemies?</hi> He knew not what to do; at laſt (if he did not by himſelf) to ſave himſelf, he made uſe of his Couſin <hi>Baſs's</hi> Man's Device, who threw up his Cap, and cry'd, <hi>Hey for King</hi> Charles, <hi>Hey for King</hi> Charles, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covert of that Lye, and the Dark, he got by Mid-night to <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle; But the Fright had ſuch an effect upon him, and made ſo deep an Impreſſion upon his Spirits, that ſome ſtuck not to ſay, that for the time he was beſide his Wits; which he no ſooner recover'd, but he comes into <hi>Eſſex</hi> to Lye (as a <hi>Jack-an-apes</hi> does Tricks) for his Maſter's Advantage. And here he tells the People ſtrange Stories of the Fight (but not a word how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly like <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit he ran away) and that to his knowledge (tho' he was in too much haſte to tell the Slain) the King's Party loſt five to one of the Parliament; which in one ſenſe was true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of the King's Party was worth five of them; elſe 'tis an untruth: For the even Scales of days Fight, was too ſad a preſage of that lingring which follow'd.</p>
               <p>I am now enquiring after his Humility, if I could find it: I ſee him among his Leathern Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and the makers of Leather and Doublets;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95382:17"/>theſe he loves by inſtinct: ſurely I have found it now. But while I judge him by this Company (whom he makes believe are precious to him) one whiſpers me in the Ear, and tells me that I take a wrong meaſure: For theſe poor Chriſtian's Backs are but Blocks to mount him high in the eſteem of the round World. He would have made an excellent Judge; for he was no Reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. If Knights, or Ladies, or Perſons of ever ſo good Condition, had come where he was ſitting, he would neither ſtir his Breech, nor his Cap; it was condeſcention enough to give them a gracious Nod with his Head; (for his ſtiff Neck did not often bend) which Carriage of his, made ſome of his own Party ſay in my hearing, <hi>That they thought there was not a prouder Parſon upon Earth than Mr.</hi> Marſhall. Mr <hi>Symonds</hi> will tell you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this, and how his Pride would not ſuffer any man to croſs his irrational Dictates; and how he treated that Holy and Reverend man the World knows. Tho' I have ſometimes heard, that his not anſwering Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> was becauſe he could not anſwer; and in ſuch caſes he was ſo wiſe as to hold his peace: For I remember, when he boaſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> of <hi>Stebbing,</hi> That he had brought Burial of the Dead out of Faſhion in his Town; Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> told him, That their <hi>Directory</hi> gave leave to exhort at the Grave. His anſwer was, then may they have a Funeral Sermon who deſire it; but when the other reply'd, the Poor would complain, that the Rich ſhould have Chriſtian Burial, and they, becauſe Poor, be bury'd like Dogs. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s anſwer was <hi>Mum.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95382:17"/>
               <p>And tho' he was a ſevere Cenſurer of Biſhops and others of the Epiſcopal Clergy, for medling in Civil Affairs, as excentrick to their Calling; yet himſelf could make it his buſineſs (as well as <hi>Nye, Peters,</hi> &amp;c.) for ſeven years together. And tho' he had been an earneſt promoter of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Good, as he was a diſturber of the publick peace, yet could he never be able to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil of his own ſupercilious judging of others. Not that I think the Eccleſiaſtical Function neceſſarily deprives his Majeſty of the benefit he may have from the prudential abilities of Clergy-men; but I think it wretched impudence in him to charge that as a Crime upon them, who was doubly guilty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Firſt, in medling in the State. Secondly, In medling to do miſchief, and (which is no ſmall ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his fault) in that he acted the Statiſt in the Pulpit; where, inſtead of promoting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, he promoted Inſurrections. I know, ſome ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, what Peace and Satisfaction he had in acting in Secular Affairs? His anſwer was (tho' not without Stomach to be asked ſuch a queſtion,) that he had always in his Eye the Glory of God; (of which God and the World too now judge) but if you had ask'd the Pope the ſame queſtion, he would have given you the like anſwer, <hi>viz. In ordine ad Spiritualia.</hi> Well, tho' this, and to be bold, two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings be unpardonable Crimes in an Epiſcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, yet Mr. <hi>Marſhall's</hi> Godlineſs can qualifie him for both.</p>
               <p>His not being ſcrupulous himſelf about State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, made him (perhaps) leſs ſolicitous about the Scruples of others in reference to the State: For when ſome of his Pariſh (and thoſe none of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95382:18"/>meaneſt) deſired his Judgment concerning the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Engagement, he (<hi>Prevaricator</hi>-like) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> but would not reſolve what was ſafe for them in point of Conſcience, nor what himſelf had practis'd: for he was loth the World ſhould know, that he had ſwallowed the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after he had taken the Covenant, which the Hangman hath now burnt.</p>
               <p>He was eſteem'd a painful Preacher: Himſelf was wont to compute, from the time that he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſtry, to almoſt the end of his days, he had preach'd three times a week, ſetting thoſe weeks wherein he preach'd four times againſt thoſe wherein he had preach'd but twice. He preach'd indeed often, but not much; he had an art of ſpreading his Butter very thin; ſome men in one Sermon having more Pious and profitable Divinity (beſides-Learning) than he uſually had in four. Beſides, as another allay to his painfulneſs, he often preach'd the ſame Sermon over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; himſelf has boaſted, that he preach'd one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (I believe that was <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi>) threeſcore times: Yea, many of his Sermons coſt him no more pains than the tranſcribing <hi>verbatim:</hi> And this I can aſſure you is no Slander.</p>
               <p>As to his Learning (tho' he had little <hi>Greek,</hi> and no <hi>Hebrew,</hi>) yet he was competently furniſh'd with Abilities for a Paſtoral Charge in the Country, but no higher; of which himſelf was conſcious: And therefore would never accept any Univerſity Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment (leſt he ſhould make himſelf ridiculous,) nor never Commenced <hi>Doctor:</hi> Indeed he took the Degree of Batchelor in Divinity <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> but it is ſaid his Tutor Dr. <hi>Garnons</hi> made his Excellent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95382:18"/>Poſition, and that ſomebody elſe made, or help'd him to make his <hi>Clerum.</hi> His ſitting ſo long time in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had ſomewhat improv'd his Abilities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was judg'd fit with Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> to be a diſputing Commiſſioner at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> in the point of Epiſcopacy. A point which they had canvaſs'd thred-bare in the Aſſembly. Indeed they did little elſe but beat down, and trample upon that Reverend and Apoſtolick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (one Divine in a months time would have done as much as they did in ſeven years) and to the overthrow of which they had all of them contributed their ſeveral Mites,
<note n="*" place="margin">An inſignificant <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> fit to have accompanied the <hi>Covenant.</hi> They Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz d Biſhop <hi>uſher's Body of Divinity,</hi> which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their larger <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> and again epitomiz'd that Epitome, aboliſhing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church <hi>Cotehciſm:</hi> hence ſo much ignorance in the Fundamentals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that.</note> which theſe two doughty Champions having budgetted up, carried with them to the Treaty. The Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to diſpute, theſe two <hi>Eves-droppers</hi> ſtole to the Chamber door of the oppoſite Doctors, where they over-heard them reading over their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (this is Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s own Confeſſion, as well as his Boaſt) which when they had done, they ſate up all Night examining their reaſons, and preparing anſwers; of all which helps they had need, having to oppoſe ſo good a Cauſe, and ſuch able Defenders.</p>
               <p>And now you have heard of his Learning, take a caſt of his Wit: for he was venturous at that ſport. But firſt ſtop your Noſe, becauſe the Jeſts ſmell rank. Once this <hi>Scoggin</hi> requeſted a Lady, (whoſe name it is not fit to ſtain by making it here publick) that he might ſpeak his mind freely to her, which ſhe very innocently granting, the rude <hi>Presbyter</hi> ſpoke (like a <hi>Pythoniſs</hi>) from the hollow of his Belly, giving ſuch a burſt, as ſome Beaſt would do, that had newly eaten
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95382:19"/>green Tares. The ſame reply he is ſaid to have given another Gentlewoman, asking his Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's Prayer. If the other was a clowniſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, this was unhallow'd prophaneneſs. And now my hand is in the Honey-pot, take another, (provided that you read not theſe upon a full Stomach) It once hapned that he took Phyſick in an Houſe which he much frequented, and at the ſame time the Miſtreſs of the Houſe alſo had taken a Purge; and having but one Eaſement, which ſtood conveniently between both their Chambers, the Gentlewoman had got poſſeſſion of it, when Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi>'s Phyſick began to wring and gripe, and deſire a Writ of Ejectment; he therefore calls to his Miſtreſs to make haſte, which her own need delaying, ſhe cries out for his patient ſtay; his reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty being almoſt overcome, he tells her, if ſhe does not give way, he muſt diſcharge himſelf in her Lap; but this being a matter <hi>ex officio,</hi> out of modeſty I ſhall contract it with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned modeſty, it puts me in mind of a Sermon that I heard him preach at <hi>Saffron Walden</hi> about 15 or 16 years ago upon this Text, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. v. 12, 13. <hi>The Iniquity of</hi> Ephraim <hi>is bound up, his ſin is hid; the ſorrows of a travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman ſhall come upon him, he is an unwiſe ſon, for he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of the breaking forth of Children.</hi> Which Metaphor he did ſo plainly open, and ſo cloſely purſue, and ſo pertinently apply, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Women hung down their Heads bluſhing: And ſome of them in my hearing, ſaid, they never heard ſuch a bawdy Sermon in their lives.</p>
               <p>His wit was not without wealth; for by a kind of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> he created to himſelf out of nothing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate (as it has been computed) worth 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and left it to his Children; which is more than one of the laſt Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> out of his great Revenue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95382:19"/>had to bequeath to his Relations: Which his Siſter <hi>Newman</hi> took an occaſion to note, when at a Meeting, ſhe told a Lady, that the World was well amended with her Brother (who was preſent) ſince the time he and ſhe us'd to go a Gleaning together, when he would cudgel her Coat, if ſhe did not ply her buſineſs; and thus ſhe was even with him for ſaying before ſome Gentleman, that ſhe look'd like a Witch in a Play.</p>
               <p>But to let theſe ſmall things paſs, and draw to a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od with my Subject: Honeſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> for all his Favour, Wit, Learning, Honour, Cunning, Wealth, muſt die, die of a Conſumption too, who had help'd to conſume ſo much of the Kingdom's Blood and Treaſure, and of the Churches Vitals and Beauty. His Sickneſs was long and tedious, which made him a very <hi>Skeleton,</hi> and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpectacle before his Death. Some report, that like <hi>Henderſon,</hi> he died full of horrour and deſpair; they that ſpeak moſt ſparingly of him, ſay, he had not that aſſurance of his Salvation, that he expected to have had at his Death.</p>
               <p>Death and Judgment are ſolemn things, and give a man a truer, and leſs flattering view of his actions, than covetous and ambitious Intereſts will let him ſee. I preſume not to judge his future Eſtate; to his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he ſtood or fell: his Conſcience being awakened, he might, and ſo others may find more truth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the firſt ſentence of our Liturgy (tho' they call it a Lye) than in all their thin notions of Divinity.</p>
               <p>He was of a middle Stature, thick Shouldered, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Complexion, his Eyes always rowling in his Head. when he talked with any man, he never look'd in his face, but caſt them this way and that way, which ſome interpreted as an argument of a jealous mind and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious of Miſchief. His Deportment was clowniſh, like his Breeding; his Garb ſlovenly (ſometimes preaching
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95382:20"/>without his Cloak) his Gate ſhackling, and the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within not unlike the outſide.</p>
